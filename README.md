# Svelte Grid Gallery

## Get started

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app
running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see
your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow
connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to
include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimized version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```
